# Why 'a_c_californiacondor_01.ymt' is steamed?
Because we want to fix default outfit for Condor. Why? Because we replace Condor drawables by dragon.

# But you also stream 'a_c_californiacondor_01.ymt', why?
Well, we can use only `a_c_californiacondor_01.ymt`, yes, but we decided to create separate ped for out dragon. However, this ped use Condor drawables. We don't know how to make add-on drawables without replacing vanilla one. Let's hope in future we'll be able to stream `assets_drawable.ymt`, then we utilize it to create full add-on dragon without replacing condor model.
